# Frisbee-Analysis-py-
This project aims to use ultimate frisbee data collected from ultianalytics.com, in order to predict the outcome of a point of ultimate. Data is available for any team that uses the stat-keeping app (AUDL or otherwise), and the notebook is designed to function for any team (for best results use an AUDL team, whose datasets typicaly have 500+ points).

This is a start-to-finish machine learning project. It includes formatting data to be ready for machine learning algorithms, extracting and engineering features, selecting features with ANOVA, polynomial features and dimensionality reduction, and multiple prediction algorithms.
